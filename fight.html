                The latest war is not just being fought with guns, but also computers. The biggest cyberwar in history is being fought right now.<br>
                Whether you are from Ukraine or Russia it has most definitely impacted your life in one way or another.<br>
                Russian and Ukrainian hackers have been attacking each other and their countries. The most common attack which has been taking place is a DDOS or DOS attack which is essentially flooding the server's connection to slow or stoping it preventing other people from connecting.<br>
                There have been many groups of united people across the world communicating via telegram and other encrypted messaging apps. <br>
                Most of the groups have thousands of people that all come together to take down their opposing countries' instructors by DDOSing or hacking sights using XSS / MySQL and other common exploits.<br> 
                There have also been foreign hackers attacking the opposing country a promotable example is how anonymous hacked into Russia's top censorship agency and leaked all of their data which is now public. I have links to some of the public telegram channels listed below<br>
                Notable Hackers and groups are not the only people contributing to the latest cyberwar. new groups have started to pop up excepting members all in the name of their country most of these groups haven't done anything notable besides DDOSing common websites.<br> 
                The majority of groups are on the Ukrainian side but that's not to say that there is not a massive amount of hackers attacking Ukraine's cyberspace.
